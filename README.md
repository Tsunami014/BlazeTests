# Blaze-Tests
A buncha games to test the capabilities of [BlazeSudio](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/)!

Make sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` first. If it still doesn't work try building BlazeSudios from source (some features here may not be in a release yet). Info on how to do that is on [the Blaze Sudio repo](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-installing-from-source)

Anything without credit can be assumed to be made by me. No guarantees tho. If I'm missing anything feel free to tell me on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xr3phyEZtv) or via Github issues.

# Games
## Gravity Golf
Play golf across the galaxy! Uses the physics engine to have cool gravity effects!
### Credits
The `Inca_front_by_Kronbits-extended.png` is assumedly by Kronbits. //TODO: Find original source.

## Basic-1
One of LDtk's main levels brought to life with Blaze!
### Credits
The `Cavernas_by_Adam_Saltsman` is one of the default tilemaps that comes with LDtk. No clue where it comes from, assumedly "Adam Saltsman". //TODO: Find original source. Also, the first level in it was originally from LDtk too, with modifications to add entities; but I made the second level.

## Planet Wrapping
A quick demo, mainly for testing, of easily making planets for games!
### Credits
Like before, this uses `Cavernas_by_Adam_Saltsman`, but I modified it to include transparency.

## Are you sure?
A game to test the graphics. You need to make *absolutely sure* you want to play this game!
